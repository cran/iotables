iotables
========

The symmetric input-output tables (SIOTs) are complex statistical products that present inter-related statistics in a predefined structure. They are often found in spreadsheets that follow this structure, or in the case Eurostat in a data repository. In both cases they in reproducible research must be downloaded and restructured to programmatically accessible form. Often these highly structured statistics need to be analyzed together with other data, for example, when employment effects and multipliers are calculated. In this case processing the employment data to SIOT conforming format is a significant preprocessing challenge.

The iotables are exactly designed for these tasks. Currently the package downloads and processes standardized European SIOTs conforming to the latest statistical regulations, i.e. SIOTs starting from the year 2010.

The aim of this introduction is not to introduce input-output economics, or SIOTs in detail. The [Eurostat Manual of Supply, Use and Input-Output Tables](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/5902113/KS-RA-07-013-EN.PDF/b0b3d71e-3930-4442-94be-70b36cea9b39?version=1.0) and the [Eurostat tematic page](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/esa-supply-use-input-tables/methodology/symmetric-input-output-tables) \['Eurostat Manual' in the documentation\] should be consulted for further information about the data and the metadata.

In order to test the analytical functions of the package and to have a manageable sized example data set, we use the real-life data from the Eurostat manual. The `germany_1990` dataset is a simplified 6x6 sized SIOT taken from the Eurostat SIOT manual (page 481). The package function examples can be checked against [JÃ¶rg Beutel's published results](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/5902113/KS-RA-07-013-EN.PDF/b0b3d71e-3930-4442-94be-70b36cea9b39?version=1.0).

Installation
------------

You can install iotools from CRAN or the latest development version with github:

``` r
install.packages("iotables")
devtools::install_github("rOpenGov/iotables")

#with vignettes:
#devtools::install_github("rOpenGov/iotables", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

You can follow changes on the NEWS.md file.

Acquiring data
--------------

Eurostat's data can be downloaded in several tidy, long-form, files, and a lot of filtering is needeed to start working with it.

Currently the following Eurostat SIOTs can be used:

-   product x product SIOTs `naio_10_cp1700` or `naio_10_pyp1700`;

-   industry x industry SIOTS `naio_10_cp1750` or`naio_10_pyp1750`;

-   trade and transport margins `naio_10_cp1620` or `naio_10_pyp1620`, only with `stk_flow = 'TOTAL'`

-   net taxes less subsidies `naio_10_cp1630` or `naio_10_pyp1630`, only with `stk_flow = 'TOTAL'`.

The `cp` element refers to basic prices and the `pyp` to previous years' prices.

Vignettes
---------

The [Germany 1990](http://iotables.ceemid.eu/articles/germany_1990.html) vignette presentes most of the examples of the [Eurostat Manual of Supply, Use and Input-Output Tables](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/5902113/KS-RA-07-013-EN.PDF/b0b3d71e-3930-4442-94be-70b36cea9b39?version=1.0) (Eurostat Manual, Chapter 15.) This is a good introduction to understand what will the functions do, and to check that they work correctly. The `testthat` infrastructure of the package checks the proper working of the functions against the published results from the Eurostat Manual.

The [Working with Eurostat Data](http://iotables.ceemid.eu/articles/working_with_eurostat.html) vignette shows how you can download, pre-process and use real data from Eurostat.
