\title{Create an input coefficient matrix}
\usage{
input_coefficient_matrix_create(input_flow, output, digits = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_flow}{An input flow matrix created with the \code{\link{use_table_get}} function.}

\item{output}{An output vector with a key column, created by \code{\link{output_get}}.}

\item{digits}{An integer showing the precision of the technology matrix in digits. 
If not given, no rounding is applied.}
}
\description{
Create an input coefficient matrix from the input flow matrix and the
output vector. The two input vectors must have consistent labelling, i.e
the same column names must be  found in the use table (input flow) and the
output vector.
}
\details{
If there are zero values in the output vector, they will be changed to 
0.000001 and you will get a warning. Some analyitcal equations cannot be 
solved with zero elements. You either have faulty input data, or you have 
to use some sort of data modification to carry on your analysis.

An alternative that is not implemented here, because it requires analytical
judgment, is the aggregation of elements into larger ones that are no longer
equal to zero, i.e. merging an industry or product class that has a positive 
value with another industry or product class that is zero.
