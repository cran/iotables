\arguments{
\item{geo}{The country code.}

\item{year}{The year.  The average employment will be created for the given
year, starting with \code{2008}, when the NACE Rev 2 was introduced in

\item{labelling}{Either \code{"iotables"} or the applicable short code, 
for product x product SIOTs \code{"prod_na"} and in the case of industry x 
industry SIOTs \code{"induse"}.}

\item{data_directory}{Defaults to \code{NULL}, if a valid directory, it will try to save the pre-processed 
data file here with labelling.}

\item{force_download}{Defaults to \code{FALSE}. It will use the existing downloaded file
